Array - [] - size of array is fixed once initialized in the memory with a specific length

Collection
	List 			Set				Map
	
1) List:
	- objects add(append)/insert/remove/get from list
	- can have duplicates
	- add (append) is done at last
	- it grows as needed
	Implementations:
		- ArrayList
		- LinkedList
Stack and Queue - specialized lists with specific functionality
Stack - LIFO or LCFS
Queue - FIFO or FCFS
	
2) Set (no duplicates)
	- does not have duplicates
	- you dont have operations to get objects by index
	- You can only check if the given object exists
	- it grows as needed
	Implementations
		- HashSet (does not store in ascending/descending - order is not guaranteed)
		- TreeSet (stores in increasing/decreasing)
		
3) Map (key-value pairs)
	- stores key-value pairs
	- does not guarantee the order of elements as they are inserted
	- it grows as needed
	Implementations
		- HashMap (does not store in ascending/descending)
		- TreeMap (stores in increasing/decreasing of keys)

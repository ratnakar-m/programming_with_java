Set is a datastructure that allows you to store unique objects. 
unique means => there are no two objects in the set that are equal


(In other words, it does not allow you to store duplicate objects)

For primitve types and strings it is easy to tell whether they are unique or not

What about objects?

Employee a = new Employee(1, "Laxmi");
Employee b = new Employee(2, "Bharat");
Employee c = new Employee(3, "Krishna");
Employee d = new Employee(1, "Vani");

Set s = new HashSet();
s.add(a);
s.add(b);
s.add(c);
s.add(d);

System.out.println(s.size())


class Employee{
.
.
.
.
	public boolean equals(Object o)
	{
		Employee e = (Employee) o;
		retun this.id == e.id;
	}
.
.
.

}

How to View java as real life scenarios

- Creation of object
Student st = new Student(); 

- Object has a state and a behavior
	state => object/instance variables  eg: st.id, st.name, st.birthday
	behavior => object st.modeOfTransportation()
	
- Encapsulation
  the process of encapuslating both state and behavior together is called encapuslation
  
  Student x = new Student(10,"Rajesh", "10-09-91");
  Student y = new Student(12,"Alex", "11-06-93");
  
  x.changeName("XYZ")
  y.changeName("ABC");
  
	
- Inheritance
	inheriting the object state as well as behavior from the super/parent/base class
												             sub/child/derived
															 
															 
	Generalization
	Specialization
	
- Class, Abstract Class, Interface

Class - has all the methods implemented. You can instantiate a class.
(instantiate => create an object of the class)

eg: Student class has all the methods implemented and it can be instantiated using new.

Abstract class - it does not have complete implementation. It cannot be instantiated.


	
- Polymorphism

	Student X;
	X = new Calculator();
	
	
class Student extends Person{
}
	
	
	
	
	x = new Student(10,"Rajesh", "10-09-91");

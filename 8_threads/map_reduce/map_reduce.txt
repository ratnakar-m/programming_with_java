Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]
Problem: Find the sum of above numbers

- divide input into batches (say, 3 batches)
   [1,2,3,4]
   [5,6,7,8]
   [9,10,11,12]
   
- Map
	batch input -> intermediate output
	
	[1,2,3,4]  -> 10
	[5,6,7,8]  -> 26
	[9,10,11,12] -> 42
	
- Reduce
	10 + 26 + 42 = 78
